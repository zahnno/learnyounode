test.txt If you're looking for an easy way to count the number of newlines in a  
  string, recall that a JavaScript String can be .split() into an array of  
  substrings and that '\n' can be used as a delimiter. Note that the test  
  file does not have a newline character ('\n') at the end of the last line,  
  so using this method you'll end up with an array that has one more element  
  than the number of newlines.
